Rust 中孤儿规则
we can’t implement external traits on external types.
we can’t implement theDisplaytrait onVec<T>within ouraggregatorcrate, becauseDisplayandVec<T>are defined in the standard library and aren’t local to ouraggregatorcrate.
This restriction is part of a property of programs calledcoherence, and more specifically theorphan rule, so named because the parent type is not present.
This rule ensures that other people’s code can’t break your code and vice versa.
Without the rule, two crates could implement the same trait for the same type, and Rust wouldn’t know which implementation to use.
